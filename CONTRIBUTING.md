## Coding Standards

### PHP Standards

- Follow PSR-12 coding standards
- Use strict typing: `declare(strict_types=1)`
- Type hint all method parameters and return types
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Write self-documenting code with minimal comments

### Documentation

- Update README.md for any user-facing changes
- Add PHPDoc blocks for complex methods
- Include usage examples for new features
- Update CHANGELOG.md following the format

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new classes and methods
- Write feature tests for CLI commands and integrations
- Achieve at least 90% code coverage for new code
- Use descriptive test method names
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

#### Test Examples

```php
#[Test]
public function it_can_extract_translation_keys_from_php_files(): void
{
    // Arrange
    $content = '<?php echo __("Hello World"); ?>';
    $scanner = new FileScannerService();
    
    // Act
    $keys = $scanner->findTranslationFunction($content);
    
    // Assert
    $this->assertContains('Hello World', $keys);
}
```

### Git Workflow

1. **Branching**: Create feature branches from `main`
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/add-new-provider
   ```

2. **Commits**: Use descriptive commit messages
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add support for DeepL translation provider"
   ```

3. **Pull Requests**: Include clear descriptions and link issues
   - Explain what the change does
   - Why the change is necessary
   - How to test the change

## Types of Contributions

### Bug Fixes

- Always include tests that verify the fix
- Reference the issue number in the commit message
- Ensure the fix doesn't break existing functionality

### New Features

- Discuss major features in an issue first
- Follow existing patterns and conventions
- Include comprehensive tests
- Update documentation

### Performance Improvements

- Include benchmarks if possible
- Ensure changes don't affect functionality
- Document performance gains

### Documentation

- Fix typos and improve clarity

## AI Provider Integration

When adding new AI providers:

1. Create a new method in `AITranslationService`
2. Add configuration in `config/localizator.php`
3. Add language code mappings if needed
4. Include comprehensive tests
5. Update documentation with configuration examples

### Example Provider Addition

```php
private function translateWithNewProvider(array $texts, string $sourceLanguage, string $targetLanguage): array
{
    $apiKey = $this->config['api_key'] ?? null;
    if (!$apiKey) {
        throw new \Exception('New Provider API key not configured');
    }

    // Implementation here

    return $translations;
}
```
